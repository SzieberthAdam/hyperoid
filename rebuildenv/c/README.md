Hyperoid Re-Build Environment C Drive
=====================================

This is the directory which will be mounted as `C:` drive in the DOSBox development environment.

The `startdosboxenv.bat` file will ensure that the `HYPEROID` and the `REBUILD` directories are
linked to its root. You should not copy them into this directory.

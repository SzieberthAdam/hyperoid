Hyperoid Re-Build Environment
=============================

This is the development environment prepared for the project.

Just run the `startdosboxenv.bat` to set it up. If you have all the dependencies installed, you
can build the game by starting `REBUILD.BAT`.


Dependencies
------------

Once there, you have to install some propertiary tools in order to be able to build the game:

* **Microsoft C Professional Development System 6.0a** installed into default directories
  (`C:\C600`). Medium memory model and floating point emulator are a must settings. However, I
  recommend you to enable all math modes and memory models, and also keep the component
  libraries. This let you all the build settings availabe to toy with.

* **Microsoft Windows 3.0** installed into `C:\WINDOWS`.

* **Microsoft Windows 3.0 SDK** installed into default subdirectories (`C:\WINDEV`).

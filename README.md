Hyperoid Re-Build Project
=========================

**Status: PARTIALLY SUCCEEDED**

I was able to build a working HYPEROID.EXE file from the officially published source code.
Unfortunately I was not able to build a bit-exact clone yet (see Issues below).

_Thank you Edward Hutchins for this wonderful and high quality Win16 game and the source!_


Issues
------

* My build has an extra ___EXPORTEDSTUB export in it and the disassembly is still different.
